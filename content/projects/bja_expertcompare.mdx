**Editor** — The advent of ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (UGRA) has revolutionised the practice of regional anaesthesia 
including peripheral nerve blocks. Compared with traditional surface landmark techniques that anaesthesiologists use to 
gauge the location of nerves, UGRA offers continuous visualisation of the nerves and surrounding sonoanatomy. 1 This live 
visualisation allows for a more precise spread of the injectate around a nerve, faster sensory onset, and an overall 
increase in blocking success rate. 2 As a result of the rapid adoption of this imaging technology, identification 
(segmentation) of anatomical structures in ultrasound images has become a significant research area, particularly in 
relation to the development of machine learning models for tasks related to diagnostics or anaesthetic procedures. 3 In this 
study, we aimed to determine a clinically relevant threshold for image segmentation by assessing intra-labeller and 
inter-labeller variability in anaesthetists when segmenting ultrasound images.
