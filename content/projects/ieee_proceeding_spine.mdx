**Abstract** - Lumbar punctures present a specific challenge in various medical specialties; appropriate simulators need to 
take into account the specific technical difficulties related to a realistic patient population, but currently fail to 
address the variety of anatomical differences seen in practice. We interviewed several leaders in the field of 
anesthesiology with extensive experience in lumbar puncture procedures, subsequently developing a more realistic training 
simulator. This novel simulator was built using silicone-based materials and advanced 3D-printing techniques, specifically 
tailored to be capable of mimicking a variety of patient populations without having to dispose of essential components after 
each use. Two Anesthesiologists with at least 20 years of experience were asked to perform several spinal tap procedures. 
Following testing, experts rated the simulator based on its procedural realism, usefulness in improving skill set, and 
overall simulation efficacy.The gathered validation outcomes based on the questionnaire evaluations completed by experts 
show excellent preliminary results, with an overall mean score of 4.8 out of 5 (96%). These preliminary results highlight 
the potential for the simulatorâ€™s application as a tool to improve medical simulation education and future patient 
outcomes.
