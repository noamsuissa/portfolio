**Abstract** - Ultrasound guided nerve blocks are increasingly being used in perioperative care as a means of safely 
delivering analgesia. Unfortunately, identifying nerves in ultrasound images presents a challenging task for novice 
anesthesiologists. Drawing from online resources, here we attempted to address this issue by developing a deep learning 
algorithm capable of automatically identifying the transversus abdominis plane region in ultrasound images. Training of our 
dataset was done using the U-Net architecture and artificial augmentation was done to optimize our training dataset. The 
Dice score coefficient was used to evaluate our model, with further evaluation against a test set composed of manually drawn 
labels from a pool of (n=10) expert anesthesiologists.Across all labelers the model achieved a global Dice score of 73.31% 
over the entire test set. These preliminary results highlight the potential effectiveness of this model as a future 
ultrasound decision support system in the field of anesthesia.
