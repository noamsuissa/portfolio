In this project, a Kaggle competition hosted by UW Madison in 2022, I attempt to train a deep learning model to automatically segment and highlight the stomach and intestines of GI cancer patients' MRI scans.

The aim of this competition is to assist radiation oncologists to better aim the high doses of X-Ray beams at the cancerous regions all while avoiding the healty tissues. Additionally, treatment times would be drastically reduced as
radiation oncologists would end up spending less time manually delineating the healthy regions in each MRI slice.

Stay tuned for my results on this project...
