In this project, a Kaggle competition hosted by UW Madison in 2022, I attempt to train a deep learning model to automatically segment and highlight the stomach and intestines in MRI scans of GI cancer patients.

The aim of this competition is to assist radiation oncologists in better targeting high doses of X-ray beams at the cancerous regions while avoiding the healthy tissues. Additionally, treatment times would be drastically reduced 
as radiation oncologists would spend less time manually delineating the healthy regions in each MRI slice.

Stay tuned for my results on this project...
